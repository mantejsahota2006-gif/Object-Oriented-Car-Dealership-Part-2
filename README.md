# Project Title

## Description of the Project

I updated my car dealership program to support selling and leasing vehicles. Now, when a customer buys or leases a car, the system records a contract, calculates payments, and removes the car from inventory. I also set it up to save all contract records to a contracts file for tracking sales and leases.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a sales representative, I want to search vehicles by different criteria so that I can quickly find options for customers.
- As a dealership employee, I want to sell a vehicle and record a sales contract so that customer purchases are tracked and the inventory stays accurate.
- As a leasing agent, I want to create lease contracts only for eligible vehicles so that lease rules are followed and records are maintained.
- As a finance employee, I want the system to calculate monthly payments for financed purchases and leases so that I can provide accurate payment plans to customers.
- As a dealership manager, I want all contract and inventory changes saved to files so that data is persistent and available for review.
